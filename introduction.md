# Devcon VI wiki

Welcome to the Devcon VI wiki! This is a place to collect all the information about Devcon VI, the sixth Ethereum developer conference. It is a community effort, so please feel free to contribute!

This year there were 444 speakers, so, if you are planning to catch-up on all the talks, even if it is just for one of the tracks it would take you a couple weeks, full-time. So, many of us might have already taken notes of talks or workshops, or are now catching-up on some talks. So here is a place where you can just add your notes and share them with the community. We welcome speakers to review and contribute to the notes as well as linking to their slides. 

There were many great side-events

## How to contribute

If you have notes from a talk or workshop, please add them to the wiki. You can do this in two ways:

1. If you are familiar with GitHub, fork this repository and create a pull request, adding your notes to the wiki. 
2. If you are not certain how to do this, please create an issue in this repository, and we will add your notes to the wiki.

## web3wiki idea
If you like the idea please reach out, we are trying to validate if there is a need for a community-driven wiki for web3. A more neutral place where anyone can contribute their knowledge and learn from others. Think of it like Wikipedia for Web3.
