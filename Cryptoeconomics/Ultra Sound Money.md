Description:      
This talks paints a big picture for ETH the asset and its macro cashflows. We discuss unique dynamics arising from:

* *fee burn* (ETH for blockspace payments)
* *issuance* (ETH for validator incentivisation)
* *staking* (ETH for economic security)
* *defi collateral* (ETH for economic bandwidth)


# No Ethereum without ETH
The 1 Devcon talk about ETH as the asset. 
Without Ether as the asset, there is no Ethereum.

If Ethereum becomes the settlement layer for the internet, the ETH will become internet money.

## Temperature of money (velocity)
Think of money as water which can be in multiple states:
- solid 游븱  
- liquid 游눦  
- gas 游눧  

### Temperature of money on Layer-1

on L1 you can take ETH 游눦:
- stake ETH 游볼 (turning it solid 游븱) and reducing the velocity of ETH  
- burn ETH 游댠 and consuming it with fees (turning it into gas 游눧)  

### Temperature of money on Layer-2s

Similarly On L2 you can use ETH:
- as collateral 游븱 (bonding 游낁)  
- as currency 游눦 (transacting游대)  

[Currency](https://www.etymonline.com/word/currency) comes from the word [current], money that is moving. For Ethereum we should not be discounting the low velocity use cases like staking or using it as collateral.

### Programmable money
Ether can be programmed in various ways, similar to a stem cell that can be fully programmed to be a brain, liver or heart cell.

ETH can be programmed to contribute towards the:
- Security by staking 游볼 = contributing towards the **security** of the network.  
- Sustainability with base fees 游댠 = contributing towards its economic **sustainability** and security.  
- Bandwidth through collateral 游낁 = in the context of DeFi by using it as collateral.  
- Economic Activity when used as currency 游대  

There are two different economies:
Cold economy mostly collateral money (游볼 and 游낁).  
Hot economy mostly liquid money (游댠 and 游대).  
> Both are extremely important for the network.

This talk will go through the various uses of ETH that help Ethereum become a settlement layer for the internet of value:
1. Security   
2. Sustainability 游댠  
3. Bandwidth 游낁  
4. Activity 游대  
# 1 - Security 游볼

## Security Ratio
If ETH is going to settle the internet of value, it should not get crushed by the economic weight of it ([total value secured meme](./../assets/totalvaluesecuredmeme.jpeg)). The internet of value will be massive, 10s of Trillion of Dollars, and we cannot have the internet of value be secured by a tiny amount of security.

Security ratio = total value secured / economic security

Right now there is 0.37T USD of total value secured, a security ration of 20x. The lower the ratio the better. 
Ethereum is securing roughly $400B of value in form of ETH ($161.7B), ERC20s ($188.35B) and NFTs ($22.95B) with $20B of ETH as economic security.

### Economic security
Ethereum has 20B$ of economic security. For a nascent project it is a good amount, as it is already the most secure blockchain. Surpassing Bitcoin by 2x ($10B of economic security).

A 51% attack on Ethereum is roughly $20B compared to $10B on Bitcoin. Yet, the endgame should be to have an economic security in the trillion of dollars, so we can keep the ratio as low as possible, to make it safe from the most sophisticated attackers like a nation state for example.

### ETH deposits
The economic security comes from ETH deposits. In the last two years, there has been a healthy continuous stream of deposits. An average of 20K ETH/day for 2-years. Today we have 14.2 ETH staked 游볼.

If we ask ourselves how much ETH will be staked in the long-term, we can look at what incentivizes people to stake, which is Issuance.
### Issuance
Issuance is what incentivizes people to stake.

There are 2 parts to staking;
- the cold economy (staking ETH)  
- the hot economy (issuing ETH) as incentive for validators  
### Yield from Issuance

There is a relationship between the growth of ETH staked and the yield from issuance.
Every time the amount of ETH staked grows by a factor of 4x the yield from issuance decreases by a factor of 2x.

4M ETH staked = 8% yield  
16M ETH staked = 4% yield  
64M ETH staked = 2% yield  

We should expect that the yield from issuance is going to have an equilibrium with the cost of money, if the cost of money is 3% then we should expect 30M ETH staked.

### The importance of ETH price
Today we have $20B of economic security. Let's say we want to get to $1T of economic security. 

To get to $1T of economic security, we would not only need the amount of ETH staked to go up, but the price of ETH. Specifically, we need the price of ETH to go up by 25x to get robust economic security.

### Minimum viable issuance
Issuance has negative externalities as it dilutes the holders. So, to minimize the cost of security we can decrease issuance.

2015 - [genesis](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#byzantium): issuance was at 25M ETH issued per year.  
2017 - [byzantium](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#byzantium)  
2019 - [constantinople](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#constantinople)  
2022 - [the merge](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#byzantium): issuance has decreased by roughly 25x, which is small and essentially optimal. Because we cannot improve it should be a forcing function to ossify.  

# 2 - Sustainability 游댠

## Ethereum as a company
Ethereum sells a product, secure blockspace, extremely secure.   
profits = income - expenses  

we want profits to be positive (eventually)

 = blockspace sales - security budget  
 = burn 游댠 - issuance 游둳  

This is comparable to [P/E ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp) of a tech stock.

## Supply since merge 
Since the merge, despite the massive reduction in the cost of security (issuance) Ethereum is still not sustainable.
Ethereum is still not able to pay its security from income generated from selling blockspace.
The good news however, that the un-sustainability amount is small, less than 0.1% per year [see live graph](https://ultrasound.money/).
## Issuance and burn
If we take all the data since [EIP1559](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559), we see that Ethereum is in a position to burn much faster than it is issuing. Ethereum is burning at a rate of 3.5x than today's issuance rate today. So, the supply growth is expected to be negative [live graph](https://ultrasound.money/#projection).  
### Supply growth-200Y projection
During the first 7-years of Ethereum, the supply grew very fast. The peak is around the merge after which the supply starts decreasing and finding a new equilibrium.
### Ultra sound money MEME
These projections around supply is what birthed the sound/ultra sound money meme.

# 3 - Bandwith 游낁

## Economic bandwith
ETH is used as economic bandwith for decentralized applications. Some examples of that would be:
- [Maker](https://makerdao.com/en/) 1.4M ETH as collateral for [Dai](https://daistats.com/#/)  
- [Aave](https://aave.com/) 0.5M ETH as collateral for its decentralized loans  

### Pristine collateral
The reasons ETH is a good choice for collateral is that it is "pristine", i.e. it doesn't have tail risks that other L1s might have:
- no contract risk  
- no custodial risk  
- no oracle risk  
- no bridge risk  
- no governance risk  
- The one downside is the **volatility**  

### Decentralized stablecoins
Stablecoins are a way of stabalizing ETH, some examples of those are:
- Maker for Dai (1.4M ETH)  
- ? (0.5M ETH)  
- ? (28K ETH)  

In total 2M ETH is being used to collateralize decentralized stablecoins.
### ETH as collateral
> We are in the early days of ETH being used as colateral. ETH is the perfect collateral money.
Today, we have 16M ETH used as collateral (14M ETH being staked, 2M ETH as collateral for DeFi applications).
In 10Y? We could have as much as 60M ETH used as collateral (30M ETH staked and 30M ETH used for DeFi applications).

### The importance of ETH price
ETH price is important in the context of economic bandwith.
Right now we have $1B of decentralized stablecoins that are collateralized by ETH, which in the grand scheme is not a lot. In the future we would like to have trillion of dollars in decentralized stablecoins that are collateralized by ETH.

If we want 1 trillion dollars of decentralized stablecoins, that is 1000x growth from today. If we grew the collateral by 15x we would get $15B of decentralized stablecoins. But to get to $1T we need ETH price to go up, the price of ETH would need to increase by 66x to go from $15B to $1T of dollars issued decentralized stablecoins.

### Illiquidity multiplier
There are two economies within Ethereum:
- 游눦liquid economy (Hot)
All the cashflows happen here, burn 游댠 and issuance 游둳. Burn is liquid ETH that is being burned to pay for blockspace. Issuance is "fresh" liquid ETH that is added to the circulating supply.
- 游븱illiquid economy (Cold)

One way to think about the Ethereum market cap is to look at the liquid portion. Once we understand how much the liquid portion should be worth. Then we can scale that out to the whole market cap. The scaling factor is the illiquidity multiplier.

ETH marketcap = [marketcap of liquid economy] * [1/liquidity%]

Today, most of the ETH is liquid (80%), so the illiquidity multiplier = 1/80% = **1.25x**
Once most of the ETH is used as collateral that changes.

In 10Y? the illiquidity multiplier could be 1/20% = **5x** with 80% of ETH being used as collateral.

So, if the Ethereum cashflows, the business of selling blockspace is worth $1T then the whole market cap of ETH the asset should be $5T.
# 4 - Activity 游대

## Economic activity
Activity is the amount of flows happening on top of Ethereum:
- fluidity  
- liquidity  
- diversity  
- vitality  

All sorts of applications using Ethereum, millions of transactions per second.

The only way to get to all this activity is through scalability.

### Scaling
> I believe we can scale Ethereum roughly 1Mx. 
There is a massive wave of scalability coming, like the [surge](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1550315295402668032?s=20&t=lC2Tja0SQhh3f7yVvyEljA).
There are three main technologies that compound on top of each other:
1 - [Rollups](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/#rollups) = 1K TPS
2 - [Sharding](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/#sharding) = 100K TPS
3 - [Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) = 10M TPS

[Nielsen's Law](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/law-of-bandwidth/) is the equivalent of Moore's Law in the context of bandwidth scaling. The only fundamental ressource that blockchain's need to consume.

### Ultrasound barrier
The ultrasound barrier is to define how much each single transaction needs to pay for Ethereum to stay sustainable, so for it to have enough income to pay for security.

The ultrasound barrier will decrease by roughly 1Mx:
- right now we need to burn 3M Gwei/tx, but as we scale 1Mx, we only need to pay 3 Gwei/tx to be sustainable. 3 Gwei is NOT A LOT, even if ETH is worth $1M, 3 Gwei would be 1.3 of a USD cent.

> For Ethereum to be sustainable, we need tx fees that are essentially dust.

### Daily Blockspace Sales 
Secure blockspace is big business. The daily blockspace sales since the start of Ethereum have been growing in price since the day Ethereum launched. Even though that the per tx fees will go down, the aggregate income should increase. Partly due to the concept of [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand) as you reduced cost more users will come and that will unlock more activity on the network.

# Big Picture Summary
Here is a summary of a potential future for Ethereum:

Supply - 100M ETH (should decrease slowly to reach this equilibrium)

These 100M ETH will be:
- partly as Staked ETH 游볼 (33M ETH)  
- partly as collateral 游낁 (33M ETH)  
- partly as currency 游대 (33M ETH)  

With 33M ETH staked this will lead to 1M ETH/year of issuance, so, the burn should match that at 1M ETH/year. The income from blockspace sales should be the billion dollars every day, even with tiny tx fees.

In the success scenario, there should be $10T of dollars of bandwidth in DeFi and $10T in decentralized stablecoins. If we reach this, then Ethereum will have succeeded in becoming the settlement layer for the internet of value.
