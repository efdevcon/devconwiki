Description:
This talks paints a big picture for ETH the asset and its macro cashflows. We discuss unique dynamics arising from:

* *fee burn* (ETH for blockspace payments)
* *issuance* (ETH for validator incentivisation)
* *staking* (ETH for economic security)
* *defi collateral* (ETH for economic bandwidth)


# No Ethereum without ETH


## Temperature of money (velocity)
Think of money as water which can be in multiple states:
- solid
- liquid
- gas

### Temperature of money on Layer-1

on L1 you can:
- take ETH and stake it (turning it solid)
- burn ETH and consuming it with fees (turning it into gas)

### Temperature of money on Layer-2s

On L2 ETh:
- is used as collateral (bonding)
- is used as currency (transacting)

### Programmable money


Staked = security
Burn = sustainability
Bonding = bandwith
Liquid = activity

Cold economy mostly collateral
Hot economy mostly liquid

# 1 - Security

## Security Ratio
MEME

### Economic security

51% attack on Ethereum is roughly 20B$ compared to 10B$ on Bitcoin. Yet, the endgame should be in the trillion of dollars, to make it safe from nation states.

### ETH deposits
20kETH/Day
14.2METH Staked

### Issuance

#### yield from Issuance

#### the importance of ETH price
25x to get robust economic security

#### minimum viable issuance
2015- genesis

2022-merge

# 2 - sustainability

## Ethereum as a company
selling secure blockspace
profits = income - expenses
we want profits to be positive

 = blockspace sales - security budget
 = burn - issuance

This is comparable to [P/E ratio's] of a tech stock calculated by ...

## Supply since merge 
ethereum is still not able to pay its security from income generated from selling blockspace

## issuance and burn

## supply growth-200Y projection

## ultrasound money MEME

## bat signal
[Ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) is a tool to help you understand the value of Ether. It is a tool to help you understand the value of Ethereum.

# 3 - bandwith

## economic bandwith
Maker 1.4M ETH as collateral for Dai
Aave 0.5M ETH as collateral for decentralized loans

### pristine collateral
no contract risk
no custodial risk
no oracle risk
no bridge risk
no governance risk
Yet it is very volatile

### decentralized stablecoins
Maker

### ETH as collateral

today

in 10Y?

### the importance of ETH price

### illiquidity multiplier

liquid economy (Hot)
illiquid economy (Cold)

in 10Y?

4 - activity

## economic activity
fluidity
liquidity
diversity
vitality
 only way there is with scalability

### scaling
the surge is coming

rollups + sharding + nielsen

### ultrasound barrier
as we scale by 1000x, how much each single transaction needs to pay for Ethereum to stay sustainable, i.e. pay for security expenses.

### daily blockspace sales 

# big picture summary

supply - 100M ETH

partly as Staked ETH 
partly as collateral
partly as currency
